# Unified Network Illumination
UNI is firmware for ESP32 LED controllers. Unlike controller software such as WLED, UNI provides better device unification: only one device acts as a host, communicating with other controllers via Bluetooth. This streamlines interaction with the network as a whole and allows the user to control an entire house from one webpage.
